# Customer churn analysis for an insurance company

In this project, we will perform a churn analysis on a dataset provided by a publicly owned insurance company that belongs to a State commercial bank. We were allowed to share this analysis as long as we don't mention the company's name. This company has not yet applied machine learning techniques and claims to have a serious churn problem in its client portfolio. The dataset encompasses the period 1997-2019, where each observation represents a customer and the variables (columns) describe aspects related to the product that each customer has, as well as geographical and user-specific factors. The dataset was provided by the company, and we had the opportunity of having a preliminary meeting with its management staff where the following points have been highlighted:

- The company sells life insurance. Their two main products are: 
  - common (they are collected by the heirs in the event of the death of the insured) 
  - endowment (after the age of 65 the client has a capital to collect)

- The company follows a persistence indicator of the portfolio, where we are told that the age of each policy shows an average of 8 years.

- Churn depends heavily on the selling channel, and mean of payment.

- Access to information for the company is not centralized, they do not use management software and they do not have the possibility of crossing data with the parent company from which the vast majority of the data comes from.

- The way the products are sold is compulsive: it is usually tied to the granting of a banking product and, in many cases, customers are not aware that they own the own.

- The value of the policy is not upgradeable, which represents an immense challenge to sustain profitability in an inflationary context (The expected inflation rate for Argentina in 2021 is over 50%).

This repo will include 3 notebooks: one for EDA, one for an inferential model, and one for a predictive model.
